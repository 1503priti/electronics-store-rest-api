# electronics-store-rest-api
Build a simple electronics store microservices project using Spring boot Spring Security and Spring Cloud.
We are building the Java back-end of a web-based electronics store’s checkout system. From the requirements below develop a set of RESTful endpoints and their implementation.
Persistence should be achieved either through an In-memory DB or Java data structures – in either case being sure to demonstrate an understanding of safe concurrent usage.

**Electronic Store’s Requirements:**

**Admin User Operations**

  -> Create a new product
  -> Remove a product
  Add discount deals for products (Example: Buy 1 get 50% off the second)
**Customer Operations**
  Add and remove products to and from a basket
  Calculate a receipt of items, including all purchases, deals applied and total price
